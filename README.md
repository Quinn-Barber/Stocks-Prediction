## Navigating the Repository
### Folders:
- Datasets: Includes all the datasets that were used to train the model. <br>
- Introduction_to_ML: A basic introduction to machine learning with Python for members in our team new to artificial intelligence. <br>
- Models: Downloaded models that can be reused without having to re-train the model for making stocks predictions. <br>
- Predictions: csv files with datapoints that include all the stock price predictions that were made. <br>
